The Shepherd (version 0.1.0) - by J. M. Potionwiz

Default Controls:
  W: move up.
  S: move down.
  A: move left.
  D: move right.
  Enter: attack / select.
  Shift: heal.
  F11: toggle fullscreen.
  Esc: pause/resume game / back out of menu. (HOLD to close game from anywhere (like if you want to rage-quit))

Goal: survive as long as possible / get the highest score.
Points are earned for attacking and defeating wolves.
Points are lost for letting your sheep get attacked.
When you defeat a wolf, you get some food, which can be used to heal yourself.
Players and sheep will slowly regain health over time.
The game is over if you run out of health, or lose your last sheep.

Enjoy!

notes:
  1. yes, I know, there's no sound.
  2. I can't guarantee the quality of the game when setting to fullscreen. It would
     probably work best if the shorter side of your monitor is a multiple of 256.
